You have faced many challenges on the journey, but you remain determined in your search.

First time move to the tavern:
As you approached the Drunken Dragon tavern, you felt a sudden sense of unease upon seeing three shady figures. The tall man with a thick beard and a sly grin and the massive brute with bulging muscles exuded a dangerous aura. You took a deep breath and entered the tavern, ready for any danger that may come his way.

Bandits (not drunk):
You step out of the Drunken Dragon tavern, and the three shady figures you saw earlier move to surround you. The tall bandit leader steps forward and demands your coin purse, but you are ready to defend yourself.

*fight*

Bandits (drunk):
You stumble out of the Drunken Dragon tavern, and the three shady figures you saw earlier move to surround you. The tall bandit leader steps forward and demands your coin purse, but you are in no shape to fight. The alcohol has dulled your senses, and you can barely even stand up straight.

You feel something heavy hit your head, and fall into darkness.

You wake up in the morning with a terrible headache. The bandits took all your gold, and there is no sign of them.

In the tavern:

You step into the Drunken Dragon tavern. The innkeeper greets you from behind the bar with a smile.  In the center of the room, a group of rowdy patrons are gathered, shouting and laughing as they down their drinks. You also spot an old woman sitting alone at a table in the corner.

t1. Talk to the inkeeper

You approach the innkeeper.
"What can I get for you today?" he asks, his eyes twinkling.

You ask innkeeper if he heard about the Heart of Elders.
"I might. What's it worth to you?"

  t1.1. Pay 10 gold.
    "Ha! You really think a few coins will buy you knowledge that even the greatest sages have failed to uncover? Dream on, traveler. If you want to know about the Heart of Elders, you'll have to look elsewhere."
    *the innkeeper doesn't want to talk to you anymore*

  t1.2. Pay 30 gold.
    "Ah, you want to know about the Heart of Elders, are you? Well, let me tell you a story. It was created by the first wizards, you see, to bring balance to the world. So powerful was it that they decided to hide it away, deep within the mountains, to protect it from falling into the wrong hands. Many have searched for it, but few have returned to tell the tale."
    *you hasn't learned anything new*

  t1.3. Walk away.

t2. Join the party

You approach the group of merrymakers, and they warmly welcome you to join their festivities. As you down mug after mug of ale, you find yourself losing track of time and becoming more and more inebriated. Eventually, you can barely stand and stumble out of the tavern, swaying unsteadily on your feet as you make your way back to your room.
*you've got drunk*

t3. Approach an old woman

You sit at the table with the old woman, you hear her muttering to herself. You ask her if she knows anything about the Heart of Elders. She looks up at you and grumps "That old man, Jacob, is the one you should talk to. He talks about it all the time. I'd rather listen to the howling wind than hear him go on and on about it."
*remember that you should find Jacob*


In the village:

You walk into the village on a sunny morning and observe the bustle of activity around you. You see a man sitting on a bench, looking sad and lost in thought. A group of women are chattering near the well, while in the distance you can see the towering spire of a church.

v1. Visit the church

A monk greets you with a nod and a warm smile.
"Good morning, traveler! May I offer you a moment of respite and healing at our church? For a small fee, of course."

    v1.1 Rest and heal (10 Gold)
      +30 Health +30 Mana

    v1.2 Ask if they need help with anything
        "As a matter of fact, we are in need of herbs that we use to prepare our potions. They grow in the forest, and if you could bring some to us, we would be most grateful."
        *gather herbs in the forest, bring here to get discount and healing potions*

    *Jacob*
    v1.3 Ask the monk if he knows where to find Jacob
        "Jacob, you say? I don't hold kindly to that man, he rarely shows his face at the church. And as for where he might be, I haven't seen him in weeks. Some say he spends his days locked up in his cottage, but I wouldn't know for certain."

    *Herbs*
    v1.4 Give herbs to the monk
    "You have done us a great service! Don't hesitate to come back if you ever need a place to rest or heal."


v2. Apporach the sad man

You see a young man sitting with his head in his hands. He looks up as you approach and you can see the tears in his eyes. You ask what happened.
"My family heirloom, a necklace passed down from generation to generation, was stolen by a goblin! I feel like a part of me is gone, and I don't know what to do!"

    v1.1 Leave him be
    *Jacob*
    v1.2 Ask him about Jacob
    "I'm sorry, I don't know anyone by that name."

v3. Approach a group of women

    v3.1 Ask about the area
Women suggest visiting the local tavern, where one can find travelers and locals alike.
They mention the nearby forest, filled with an abundance of herbs and wildlife.
They warn you about the swamp, home to many dangerous creatures.
One of them tells you about a Troll that lives under the bridge on the way to the mountains. The Troll is a grumpy and greedy creature, who demands toll from anyone who wants to cross the bridge.

    v3.2 Ask about their problems
Women mention guards stationed on the path to the swamp, who they say have been causing trouble for travelers.
Also they complain about mischievous goblin who has been stealing things from the villagers.
One girl warns you about the griffin that resides in the mountains, known to attack travelers who venture too close to its nest. Others giggle to that.

    *Jacob*
    v3.3 Ask if they know Jacob
"Jacob is a strange man, always talking about legends and tales from the past. He's not well-liked you know. He lives in the old hut at the edge of the village. Just follow the path that leads towards the forest and you can't miss it."
    *you know where Jacob lives*

*Jacob*
v4. Find Jacob's place

    Jacob's home is a small, run-down cottage located on the outskirts of the village. It is surrounded by overgrown shrubs and trees, and the roof is partially caved in.

    v4.1. Knock on the door
        You knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Despite this, you could hear someone moving inside the house.

    v4.2. Yell Jacob's name
        You try calling out Jacob's name, but there's no response. You start to wonder if perhaps he's not home, or if he's purposely avoiding you.

    *v4.1 and v4.2 were both tried*
    v4.3. Try to open the door
    The door is not locked. You see that the inside of the house is a mess. Furniture is overturned and there's a trail of broken objects leading to the back room. You call out Jacob's name again, but there's still no response. You decide to investigate further to see if Jacob is okay.

      -> Look around

    You find a man fast asleep in his bed, snoring softly. The room is dimly lit and quiet except for the sound of Jacob's breathing.

      -> Wake him up

    As you shake the man gently, he slowly opens his eyes and blinks a few times, looking around in confusion before finally focusing on you. "Who are you?" he asks, sounding groggy.

        0. Ask who he is
           "Aren't we the curious one? Before I tell you who I am, why don't you tell me who you are?"
        1. Tell that you are looking for The Heart of Elders
           "The Heart of Elders? I've never heard of it."
        2. Tell that you are from the city guard, and he is arrested
           "Ha! "Arrested? What for? I haven't done anything wrong lately."
        3. Tell if he doesn't do as you say, you're going to kill him
           He laughs in your face: "I've faced death many times before," he says. "Go ahead, do it if you've got the guts."

        *when all options exhausted*

        "Look, I'm getting tired of this conversation. Be on your way. I wouldn't say no to a drink though if you decide to visit again."

        *beer*
        4. Offer man a drink.

        He takes it gratefully and raises it to his lips. He takes a sip. "Ah, this is just what I needed," he says with a smile. "I've been living in this abandoned home for a while now, just trying to get by. It's nice to have some company for a change." The man then proceeds to tell you more about himself and his life, but as he talks, it becomes clear that he is not Jacob.

        5. Leave

     *if beer spent*
     As you step out of the abandoned house, you notice a tall man standing near the door, who looks as if he was about to enter the house himself. "What are you doing in my house?" the man asked, his eyes narrowed suspiciously.

     0. Ask who he is
        "Answer my question first. Why were you in my home?"
     1. Tell that you are looking for The Heart of Elders
        "In my house? Wow, you must be a legendary treasure hunter."
     2. Tell that you are from the city guard, and he is arrested
        "If you are going to pretend to be a guard, at least dress accordingly."
     3. Tell if he doesn't do as you say, you're going to kill him
        "... Are you feeling well?"

     *when 2/4 options exhausted*
     4. Try to explain the situation

     You finally are able to explain that someone is living in this home, and you have mistaken that man for Jacob.

     "So, you're saying someone was in my house? Well, I've been away for a few weeks, so I wouldn't be surprised if someone took advantage of my absence."

     -> continue

     Jacob pauses for a moment and looks thoughtful.
     "I know the Heart of Elders is hidden in a cave deep in the Shadow Peaks. Getting there is a dangerous journey, but I've been there before. I know a shortcut through the swamp, that way we can go around that Troll."
     "If you're willing to take the risk, I can tell you how to get through the swamp. However I won't join you. I risked my life far too many times in the past."

     *you now know the path from the Stinky Swamps to the Shadow Peaks*


The Stinky Swamps

  *if guards are there*

  As you approach the path leading to the swamps, you're stopped by three guards. They stand in front of the entrance, blocking your way. One of the guards steps forward.
  "No one is allowed to enter the swamps. It's too dangerous."
  You explain that you can handle yourself. The guards exchange skeptical glances, sizing you up.
  "Even if that is true we can't make any exceptions. No one is allowed in."

  *if you have partied in the tavern*

  One of the guards steps forward and looks at you closely. Suddenly, his eyes light up.
  "Hey, I remember you! You were at the tavern with us a few days ago. That was one wild night!" The other guards nod in agreement, smiling.
  "We'll let you through this time, but don't make a habit of it. We wouldn't want to have to save you from the swamp creatures again, haha!"
  They step aside, allowing you to pass.

  *if you have not partied in the tavern*
  1. Look for a path around the guards
     As you consider making a detour around the guards, one of them speaks up.
     "Don't even think about it. That swamp is treacherous. The ground is unstable, and there are creatures in there that would make a meal out of you in a heartbeat. Trust me, you don't want to go that way."
     The guard shudders at the thought of the dangers in the swamp, and the other two nod in agreement.

     1.1 Ignore the warning and go around

         *GAME OVER*

         *random 1 of 3*
         1. You ignored the guards' warning and ventured into the swamp. Your steps sink into the murky water as hidden predator pulls you under. The last thing you feel is the sharp teeth of a swamp monster piercing your skin.
         2. Despite the warnings, you forge ahead. Then the ground gives way beneath your feet and you fall. Struggling to escape, you slowly sink deeper and deeper into the swamp's murky depths, never to be seen again.
         3. You ignore the guards' warning and try to find a way around. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your leg. Looking down, you see a venomous snake has bitten you. You try to drag yourself to safety, but it's too late. The snake's venom is too strong and you collapse into the murky water.

  2. Bribe the guards (75 gold)
     You reach into your pocket and pull out a pouch of coins, offering it to the guards. They take a look at each other, then back at you, considering the offer.
     "Well, we could make an exception for the right price. But you're taking your own risk, adventurer."
     They each take a coin from the pouch and step aside, letting you pass.

  3. Attack the guards

  TODO: *fight guards*


 *after the guards are passed*

  As you enter the swamp, you're hit by the stench of decaying vegetation. The ground beneath your feet is soft and squishy. Trees and shrubs grow in clusters, and vines hang down from their branches. The water in the marsh is murky, and the occasional sound of a croaking frog can be heard in the distance. The atmosphere is eerie and unwelcoming, and it's clear that navigating through this swamp won't be an easy task.

  1. Explore the swamp

     // The following is a list of things that may happen after player chooses to explore.
     // Each item has a weight, some items can only happen once.
     // The game chooses the item randomly from all possible, considering the weight.
     // For example, if weight of option A is 2, and B is 3, and C is 5  then
     //     the chance P(A) = 2 / (2+3+5) = 20%
     //                P(B) = 3 / (2+3+5) = 30%
     //                P(C) = 5 / (2+3+5) = 50%
